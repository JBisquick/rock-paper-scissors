# How it's Made:

**Tech Used:** HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

The interactive rock, paper, and scissors game was constructed using Javascript. The game was built using functions in order to play each round, generate winning text, and to play a total of five games. HTML and CSS were used to build the layout of the website.

# Lessons Learned: 

This was my first time building a website using JavaScript. I gained knowledge on how to use functions, cases, if-else statements, math functions, arrays, DOM manipulation, and events.
